# Recharge-app-Public

This project was created with React Native CLI and Node Js

Configure your firebase from Firebase google account
and replace the "XXXX" numbers in config.js  file under config folder

Right now I'm sending the Recharge request to a webhook link. it will just show that the webhook link received your request if you successfully run the code. 

To do an actual recharge you need to find a recharge API provider and configure the recharge.js file according to that and replace the "XXXXX" with your api credentials.

INITIAL SETUP :

Install Node JS and React Native.

To install React Native

Install react native Cli. https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. (remember you are not creating a new project here, you are running a existing one. so follow the steps related to that.)

Run npm install in your command prompt or Terminal wherever your npm commmad works. https://www.sitepoint.com/npm-guide/

Above step will install all dependencies for this project.

if npm command is not running then there is some issues that you would need to fix with node Js. it will take some time to search online and fix the npm/ node commands.

Have patience. it might take 2days to a week to finally fix npm, react native and the code to run. I repeat, Have patience and keep at it.

Happy coding!
